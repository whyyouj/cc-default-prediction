## Credit Card Default Analysis Project
### Project Overview
This project aims to analyze credit card default data from Taiwan between April and September 2005. The analysis focuses on understanding the patterns of default payments, demographic factors, and credit data. This project was done as part of the BT2103 Optimization Methods in Business Analytics.

### Dataset
The dataset, card.csv, contains information on 30,000 credit card clients, described by 23 feature attributes with a binary target feature indicating default (1) or non-default (0) status.

### Repository Contents
R Code: The R scripts used for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, statistical examination, and machine learning model implementation.

### Analysis Workflow
Data Cleaning: Initial processing of the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and erroneous entries.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigation of the dataset to discover patterns, anomalies, and relationships between variables.
Feature Selection: Identification of relevant features that significantly impact the prediction of credit card defaults.
Model Selection: Evaluation and selection of statistical/machine learning models based on prediction accuracy.
Model Evaluation: Assessment of the chosen model(s) using appropriate evaluation metrics.
### How to Run
Ensure you have R and the necessary packages installed. You can run the R scripts in any R environment, but we recommend using Jupyter Notebook for an integrated experience. Detailed steps for setting up Jupyter Notebook for R are included within the code comments.
